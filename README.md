# Real-Time Speech-to-Text and Audio File Conversion Project

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of real-time speech-to-text conversion and the conversion of audio from a file to text using the `speech_recognition` module in Python. The provided code demonstrates the functionality and usage of the project.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary module using the following commands:
```bash
!pip install speechrecognition
!conda install pyaudio
````

## Usage

The project provides two main functionalities:

## Real-Time Speech to Text
The code initializes the speech recognizer and continuously captures audio from the microphone. It adjusts for ambient noise and attempts to recognize the speech using Google's speech recognition API. If the recognized text is "quit," the program exits the loop.

## Audio File to Text
Additionally, the code showcases the conversion of audio from a file to text. It uses the `AudioFile` class to open the audio file and then listens to the audio, attempting to recognize the speech using Google's speech recognition API.

# Conclusion
This project serves as a practical demonstration of speech recognition in Python, highlighting real-time speech-to-text conversion and audio file conversion. It provides a starting point for integrating speech recognition into various applications, such as voice commands, transcriptions, and more.

For detailed implementation and customization, refer to the provided code and the `speech_recognition` module documentation.
